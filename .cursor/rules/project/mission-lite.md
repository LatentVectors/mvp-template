# Product Mission (Lite)

MVP Template is a reusable monorepo template that helps developers ship production-ready MVPs (landing, blog, gated app) in a day by providing a minimal-cost, low-boilerplate foundation with built-in authentication, payments, and deployment automation.

MVP Template serves solo developers, indie hackers, and small startup teams who need to move fast from idea to market validation. Unlike complex enterprise frameworks or single-use project templates, MVP Template provides a reusability-first monorepo structure with managed services integration, enabling developers to build multiple products using the same battle-tested infrastructure while focusing on business logic instead of boilerplate setup.
