# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement Lemon Squeezy payments end to end: secure HMAC-verified webhooks to sync subscription state, a minimal checkout flow with test mode, entitlement checks, and usage tracking with quota enforcement. No new dependencies; use existing payments abstraction and Node crypto for verification.
