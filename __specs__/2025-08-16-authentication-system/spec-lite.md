# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement Supabase-based authentication with Resend SMTP for email verification, enabling secure signup, login, and session-protected routes with a basic authenticated dashboard. Configure the sending domain (SPF/DKIM/DMARC), integrate `@supabase/auth-ui-react`, add route guards and session helpers, and deploy the full flow to production.
