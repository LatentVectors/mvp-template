## Technical Requirements

### Monorepo Structure
- Initialize npm workspaces in root `package.json` with workspaces configuration
- Create directory structure: `apps/`, `services/`, `packages/`, `supabase/`, `infra/`, `e2e/`, `docs/`
- Set up Turborepo configuration with `turbo.json` for build caching and task orchestration
- Configure shared TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.base.json`

### Next.js 15 Application Setup
- Bootstrap Next.js 15 application in `apps/web/` using App Router architecture

- Create base layout components: header, navigation, footer, and main layout wrapper
- Implement responsive navigation with mobile menu functionality
- Set up theming system with CSS variables and dark/light mode support
- Create reusable UI primitives using Radix UI and class-variance-authority

### Landing Page Development
- Design and implement responsive landing page with hero section, features, and CTA
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design with proper breakpoints
- Implement semantic HTML structure for SEO and accessibility
- Add proper meta tags, Open Graph, and Twitter Card support

### Development Tooling Configuration
