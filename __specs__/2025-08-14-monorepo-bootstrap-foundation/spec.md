# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Monorepo Bootstrap & Static Frontend Foundation
> Created: 2025-08-14

## Overview

Establish a production-ready monorepo foundation with Next.js 15 frontend, npm workspaces, and static site deployment to provide the structural foundation for MVP development. This phase creates the essential directory structure, development tooling, and deployment pipeline that enables rapid development of marketing sites and preparation for authenticated applications.

## User Stories

### Developer Onboarding Story

As a developer starting a new MVP project, I want to clone the template and have a fully functional development environment with modern tooling, so that I can focus on building business logic instead of configuring build systems and development tools.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer clones repository, runs `npm install`, executes `npm run dev`, and immediately has a working Next.js application with hot reload, TypeScript support, ESLint/Prettier configuration, and Tailwind CSS styling. The application includes a responsive landing page template and proper navigation structure.

### Marketing Site Deployment Story

As a startup founder, I want to deploy a professional marketing website immediately after initial setup, so that I can establish an online presence and begin collecting early user interest while the core product is being developed.

**Detailed Workflow:** After customizing the landing page content and branding, the founder pushes changes to the main branch, triggering an automatic Vercel deployment that results in a live, responsive marketing site with proper SEO foundations and professional UI components.

### Development Experience Story

As a developer working on the MVP, I want consistent code formatting, linting, and type checking across the entire codebase, so that I can maintain high code quality and avoid common errors during rapid development cycles.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer writes code with automatic formatting on save, receives immediate feedback on type errors and linting issues in their IDE, and has confidence that all team members are following the same code standards through enforced tooling configuration.
