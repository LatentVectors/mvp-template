# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Content Management & SEO Foundation Created: 2025-08-15

## Overview

Implement comprehensive content management system with MDX blog functionality and complete SEO
infrastructure to enable static marketing site with professional content capabilities. This
foundation enables rapid content creation, legal compliance, and optimal search engine visibility
for MVP launches.

## User Stories

### Marketing Content Creator

As a marketing professional, I want to create and publish blog posts using Markdown, so that I can
easily maintain a content marketing strategy without technical dependencies.

**Detailed Workflow:** Content creators write blog posts in MDX format with frontmatter metadata
(title, description, date, tags). The system automatically processes these files during build time,
generates static pages with proper SEO metadata, and creates navigation structures. Posts support
rich formatting, code syntax highlighting, and embedded components for interactive content.

### Legal Compliance Manager

As a product manager, I want legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Cookie Policy)
automatically integrated with proper footer navigation, so that the MVP meets compliance
requirements from day one.

**Detailed Workflow:** Legal pages are created from templates with placeholder content that can be
customized per product. Footer navigation automatically includes links to all legal pages. Pages
follow consistent styling and include proper metadata for search engines while remaining easily
updatable.

### SEO Specialist

As an SEO specialist, I want comprehensive SEO infrastructure (metadata, sitemaps, robots.txt, Open
Graph images) automatically generated, so that every page is optimized for search engines and social
sharing without manual configuration.

**Detailed Workflow:** The system automatically generates metadata for all pages, creates XML
sitemaps including blog posts, serves proper robots.txt directives, and generates Open Graph images
for social sharing. All SEO elements follow best practices and update automatically when content
changes.
